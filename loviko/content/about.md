My name is Oksa Dwi Nabila, called Oksa. I am 19 years old and will turning 20 this october. I was living in Sambas, kalimantan Barat before i move to Java on July of 2022 Hmm... it's been a year. Time fast by. I am in my third semester at private university in West Java, majoring Information Technology. Recently, i am doing some programming free bootcamp at the internet named frontendmasters.com, some are in youtube.

I like doing stuff like designing minimalist interface because it is clean and neat. I sometimes, using only three color of color with the same tone. But i prefer only using monochrome theme for my project. One more thing, i am now learning javascript and front-end development.

Three things about me you should know:

    1. I like editing stuffs like picture, vector, text, web, and others
    2.I like black coffee with no sugar and greentea as my favs drink
    3.I have 7 cats at home here in bogor and one cat in sambas.

I have this thought in my mind if i am feeling down.

    Just do your best and hold on God in everything
